# About Me
I am a self-taught frontend developer. I am not from a traditional background as alot of us say. I worked with horses for the first few adult years. 
Currently working at Postman as a Software Engineer. Working with the marketing and open technologies teams to build features, component and pages.
<!--I needed to find something else,  when your body doesn't recover as fast and you are always working pay check to pay check. What made me jump into tech was after a few years working in customer service jobs but never able to give the customer the service I felt they needed through the ecommerce side of things. 
I started looking around for a more flexible career path and have always gotten along with computers and curious about websites. Found a tiny bootcamp/workshop course and found I loved frontend. And here we are.-->

# What is CMS?

## Content Management System
Most people know of <strong>Wordpress</strong>. Which is a On-premises installation means that the CMS software can be installed on the server. 
A monolithic system that was designed for blogs. Around 41% of the websites using Wordpress.
Why not stick with it?
### IMO
- not a CMS by todays website usages
- not secure
- slow
- big
- Always need to update plugins
- not great SEO, have to work at it

# What is HEADLESS CMS??!!
definition:
Headless CMSes, unlike their monolithic counterparts, can deliver content to all sorts of ‚Äúheads,‚Äù like mobile apps, chatbots, voice apps‚Äìanywhere content can be delivered.

<!-- Basically, plugin and play with different sources, CDN, databases and much more. -->

2 main types of Headless CMS
- API Driven(83)
- Git-based(20)
According to Jamstack.org

<!-- you can probably guess which is more popular in the new API-first world. -->

# Why go Headless?!


<div grid="~ cols-3 gap-12">
<div class="w-md">

## Some benefits:

- üìù **Productivity** - Editors can ship more frequently
- üìà **Scalable** - Switch other pieces as needed
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer Friendly** - use workflows they prefer without impacting editors 
- üé¢ **Performance** - pre-renders pages and SEO out of the box
- üîê **Secure** - smaller area to attack, when seperate from the rest
</div>
<div></div>
 <div class="w-60">
 
## Use Cases, a few
- Websites/Web apps
- E-commerce sites
- Mobile Apps
- Products & services

My favorite frontend framework. For me it is easy to understand and work relatively smoothly. Also, I learned about this framework at one of these WWWC talks!! <br/>Shoutout Jordan!!

Sanity is a great way to learn CMS and they have nice sweatshirts! I chose for its price point of 3 free users. 
As an API driven CMS this one is well liked and has many tutorials. The docs are a little wonky right now since they have a new version. But they have slack channel that is active.
<!-- It is a little pricey if you need more.  I am hoping by then I will be more of an agency dev -->
